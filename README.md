## ☁️ Aims and objectives
The stock market has experienced huge flucuations in recent years, especially between 2020 Q1 to 2022 Q1. During this period of time, we witnessed different world events, including the outbreak of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war. I am interested to explore whether these world events would impact the stock prices of these tech companies. And whether we are able to predict future closing prices according to stock price data such as the daily opening, highest, lowest prices and volume. 

The main objectives of the project involves:
1) Analysing the stock price data of some of the largest tech companies (including Meta, Apple, Amazon and Google) between 1 Jan 2020 to 31 Mar 2022 and
2) Predicting future closing prices of the tech companies.
