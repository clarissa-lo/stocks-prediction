## ‚òÅÔ∏è Aims and objectives
Technology stocks have experienced huge fluctuations in recent years, especially between 2020 Q1 to 2022 Q1. During this period of time between 1 Jan 2020 to 31 Mar 2022, we witnessed different world events, including the outbreak of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war. I am interested to focus on the stocks of some of the largest technology companies (including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Apple) to analyse their stock price data during this time period, to explore whether these world events would impact their stock prices and to predict future stock closing prices.

Therefore, the main objectives of the project are:
1) to analyse the daily percentage changes of the technology stock closing prices
2) to explore the factors affecting the closing prices
3) to test the relationship of the closing prices between technology stocks,
4) to predict the closing prices 25 days into the future.
